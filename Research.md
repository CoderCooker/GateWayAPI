research:

  The ingress and Service original self-service model could not satisfy more complicated use cases.

  Either namespace restrict or RBAC, RBAC defines permissoions on broader scopes.

idea :
  abstract layer on top of  namespaces, using label/annotation, concept like GNS

Questions:
  How low-level protocol package forwarding are implemented or configured on ingress/envoy level ?
